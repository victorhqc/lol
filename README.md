# lol-api

## Motivation

I like League of Legends, and I want to write Rust! In order to make some projects in Rust that
use Riot's API I need a reliable wrapper to simplify my life.

## Alternatives

[Riven](https://github.com/MingweiSamuel/Riven) is an excellent crate that already works and has
brilliant documentation. If you stumbled to this project, you should consider Riven for sure. Mainly
because this is still a Work in Progress.
